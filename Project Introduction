# Frawsalla
Frawlsalla is a project we had to make for our Human and Computer Interaction course during our fourth semester. Basically, Frawlsalla is a knock-off game of Brawlhalla, and we are assigned to make the UI for Frawlhalla's game website. Therefore, this project is a way to train our abilities to develop a front-end website. Me and my friends made this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming language.

Please kindly test the website for our project using this link below:
